       "  'SPOILERS AHEAD\\n\\nThoroughly disappointing is what I’d like to call ISWU. Don’t get me wrong, I am a huge CoHo fan. So much so that I’ve read every single book of hers and I absolutely feel in love with serval of them. IEWU being my top favourite, for many reasons.\\n\\nHaving said that,lend me your ears if you’d like to save yourself extreme disappointment while reading ISWU.\\n\\nI read the reviews and still chose to get this. Why? Coz I believe in CoHo. But, honestly, I feel robbed. Cheated even. Why?\\n\\nFor starters:-\\nThe book is a complete drag and shit show when it comes to giving Atlas his due.\\n\\nWhile Lily was our protagonist in IEWS, she continues to be one in ISWU as well. This is after CoHo announcing this book is from Atlas’s pov.\\n\\nAs a result, I was left hanging in most chapters and felt frustrated not been given enough read on Atlas.\\n\\nAtlas does NOT get a chance to speak his truth more than twice. And both times, it feels lame and as he’s trying very hard to sound like the obvious nice guy.\\n\\nIt stops feeling real after a point and more like a copy paste of his reactions in every given situation.\\n\\nWhile, many said they didn’t like Lily’s letters repeated, I felt they filled the void and gave way for the plot to move ahead.\\n\\nWhat didn’t feel right at all and worse than re-reading her letters was the passing role of Ryle in ISWU.\\n\\nThe last book ended with him playing a big role in Lily’s life, not to mention her obviously stating him as an obstacle in the initial chapters of ISWU.\\n\\nSo not getting to read about him and his ‘issues’, lack of insight into more similar situations posed Ryle as not big an issue as CoHo meant for him to be.\\n\\nI wish, there was more to him than just a ‘volatile ex-husband’.\\n\\nWhat made his reactions and interactions worse was a lot of convenient occurrences and character placements in and around Lily.\\n\\nAll in all, Ryle and the need for his story not being even addressed to a single page left me questioning the lot about ISWU.\\n\\nAnother point that was superbly irritating was the mentioning of random details that were left open ended.\\n\\nEg: Theo, Atlas’s friend’s son very nervously admits he likes boys but his father doesn’t know this. This detail is mentioned early on. As the story moves ahead, another important character is introduced and you somewhere thing this character will perhaps be instrumental in helping Theo come out to his father. I mean you don’t just mention the struggle of a 13 year old kid wanting to accept sexuality in the passing, now do you?\\nAnyways, in the last few chapters, suddenly out of the blue his parents plan on taking him to a pride parade 😑 Umm… hello?\\n\\nWhat was his role? Theo’s character portrayal was extremely immature-ish. Didn’t expect that from an author whose writing is bold and impactful.\\n\\nThen there are abrupt mentions of scenes, situation and haphazard narration that had me feeling confused, somewhat hopeful and eventually disappointed. Eh: Half-hearted roles of Lucy & Allysa.\\n\\nWhile, I give 5 stars ⭐️ to CoHo to keeping her USP intact and staying true to the theme of both books — breaking generational trauma, I give her only 1.5 star for not giving Atlas enough space to grow and expand as a real person.\\n\\nAtlas is portrayed as a too good to be true human even after all that he’s been through, esply alone.\\n\\nThe plot and story is rushed on many occasions, several characters are included ONLY to fill gaps that don’t need to be filled. The major one being Theo. (Believe me, you don’t want to know how frustrating his mention is).\\n\\nI hated that several developments, scenes that were posed as possible conflicts and difficulties, were completely neglected and given a positive outcome without any resolution or addressing.\\n\\nYou’ll be left wondering what, why and how it all happened.\\n\\nI for one wanted to know why there were several mentions of certain issues or topics when they weren’t addressed, or helped the story move, but only delayed the plot.\\n\\nLastly, there is NO PLOT TWIST. None whatsoever.\\n\\nMAJOR SPOILER: Atlas never has to work hard to get Lily this time around, as one might have felt reading IEWS or the initial chapters of ISWU.\\n\\nNeither does Lily have to overcome any major struggle/conflict with Ryle to get back to Atlas.\\n\\nThrough the entirety of the book Ryle is posed as a ticking obstacle that Lily or both Lily and Atlas will have to face, until one very late chapter later Lily somehow finds the courage to stand up against him.\\n\\nMind you, no action or conversation or thought is mentioned that leads upto it. This catches you off guard and you’re left wondering you went through the whole book only to know is was that perhaps easy.\\n\\nIn all seriousness, it didn’t even feel like Lily’s love for Atlas or Emerson was the reason she chose to stand up against him.\\n\\nShe does mention she wants her daughter old enough to have overnights with Ryle when she can tell how the time went. This too is mentioned in the passing and the lack of a follow up action really makes you think if Ryle was really a problem to Lily or people with anger issues are a problem in general.\\n\\nPS: People who have been victims of abuse might not agree 100% as everyone’s struggle is different and unique in its way. I am only talking for Lily here and how her character and troubles were explained. Her win didn’t feel justified. It felt like now the story needs to come to a HEA. 🙄\\n\\nSecondly, I was absolutely devastated not seeing Atlas fall for Lily all over again. He was always in love with her, despite having had girls in his life and the book ended with him feeling the same love again.\\n\\nHis love for her does not grow it seems. It’s just stuck to when they were teens. Which is not what you expect to read after a great and mature read like IEWS.\\n\\nAlso, the lack of a growing love for Lily but just wanting her doesn’t fit the picture of the ‘good guy’ Atlas is portrayed as.\\n\\nNeither does the book have enough Lily & Atlas moments that make ISWU an Atlas book. PS: Even intimate scenes are rushed. 💔\\n\\nLily, on the other hand, does have many occasions to fall for Atlas even if you remove the overtly unbelievably perfect or rather ‘considerate Atlas’.\\n\\nI could legit go on but I feel many readers just wanted a light read with no real struggles — something that could have been done in just 5 pages of an epilogue. Honestly. Esply, if you consider how the last couple of chapters were so badly rushed.\\n\\nSo , just 2 stars for this book because I am heartbroken, devastated and expected a lot more from Colleen.\\n\\nYou gave us hope but with ISWU you took it back.\\n\\nPS: There are 2 major moments that will melt your heart for a beat. If you’re a CoHo fan they are enough but not enough if you’re a Lily & Atlas Fan ♥️',\n",

       "  \"The fourth book of the Ram Chandra series has been a longly awaited book since long, and after it's pre bookings were initiated I decided to have it straightaway. I cannot say that this book is somehow the retelling of Ramayana as it has changed many facts and introduced many new things into the story. Death of the three antagonists has been altered completely which is somehow acceptable but the fact that they were defeated by someone else rather than Shree Ram was somehow heartbreaking. Overall it's a good book although I won't say it had the best story cause of many facts. The ending fascinated me by hinting towards another book in the series which was quite remarkable.\",\n",
       "  '<b>TL;DR version:</b> This seems be written by some daily soup loving interns. The writing is cheap, full of cliches and too much repetitive. Characters do not have any depth in them. Authors didn\\'t bother to pay attention to details at many places.\\n\\n<b>Longer version:</b>\\nI read all the Shiva trilogy books and the first three books in the Ram Chandra Series. I absolutely loved all these 6 books and was a huge fan for the writing style and philosophy of Amish Tripathi.\\nAs you can guess, I was eagerly waiting for this book. I bought the book (Kindle edition) as soon as it was released.\\nIn the first three books, the story is told in a multi-linear way. The first book was on Ram, the second on Sita and the third one on Raavan. This is also the order in which I liked these three books.\\nThe post now contains spoilers. You have been warned, tread carefully.\\n\\nIt will be best if you read the other three books of the series first if you want to read this one.\\n\\nAs I started reading the book, it kept disappointing me. The book was relentless in proving that this is one of the worst books I have ever read in my life.\\nFollowing were my expectations from the book:\\n1. Brilliant war details.\\n2. Brilliance of Ram, Raavan, Hanumaan, Angad and Kumbhakaran in the war.\\n3. I expected shifting loyalty of Arishtnemi from Vishwamitra to Ram due to his interaction with Ram during the war.\\n4. <b>V vs V:</b> More details on the issues between Vishwamitra and Vashishth.\\n5. Authors version of Sita\\'s agnipariksha\\n6. Ram somehow deciding to go to Meluha and giving up Ayodhya due to conflict with Bharat.\\n\\nObviously the author is not writing the book based on my expectations and so I was ready to be surprised, and yes, I was SURPRISED.\\n\\nSo what I got from the books are the following:\\n1. V vs V story line felt like a joke.\\n2. <b>Characters:</b> All the character depth was gone. Everyone was like someone I could not associate with. I felt no feeling for all of them, Ram, Seeta, Raavan, Kumbhakaran, Hanumaan, Bharat, etc.\\n3. It was like the last season of Game of Thrones, where the directors thought the audience is due to the special effects, than due to the story.\\n4. The useless drama was like daily soup, stupid and useless. Full of cliches, hyper emotions (which you don\\'t connect with).\\n5. There were so many useless details that bored me to no end. I read them all thinking something useful will come out of it. In end, they were completely useless. Just to give an example, the details of \"Ram setu\" is so useless. It felt as if these details are given to cover up the lack of substance in the story.\\n6. The other missing point was that two people can be correct and still oppose each other. For example, the difference of opinion in case of Ram and Bharat. It used to be a feature of Amish\\'s book which was completely missing in this one.\\n7. There are many departures from Amish\\'s style of writing in this book. For example, many useless characters are given names unnecessarily. Some authors do that, some don\\'t, but at least they are consistent. It was not clear why the side characters were given names in this book. One of the useless character is named Gajaraj, then Giriraj and back to Gajaraj again.\\n8. The sentence formation in this book is absolutely pathetic at places with many sentences consisting of 1-3 words, literally.\\n9. Vishwamitra intended Ram to use Daivi Astra again. What happened? Will it happen in the next book?\\n10. It felt as if the Mara character will reappear again in this book as it was mentioned in the character details, but no.\\n11. The repetition in this book is so irritating. Again, it felt as a sign of over compensation due to the lack of quality.\\n12. The war details are pathetic. It is not clear why a brilliant strategist such as Raavan will not have scouts all over his own country. Can you imagine 100s of elephants reached their gates through ocean without Raavan knowing it? This is compounded by the fact that Raavan knew that Ram is coming through ocean route and then through road to their capital city.\\n13. If I have to use one word to describe this novel, it will be \"Cheap\". Like a cheap item you purchase which makes you want to kill yourself everyday you use it, this is what the quality of novel felt like. One example from the book \"Deepankar held the bottom of the ladder steady, ensuring that the base didn\\'t slip back.\"\\n14. Good warriors do not show contempt towards others for being less skilled. But surprise, Hanumaan and Kumbhakaran were not so honourable. Hanumaan showed (with disdain) less skilled archers how to shoot. Surprise, surprise, they became expert just by watching Hanumaan once. Why he didn\\'t prepare those useless souls before bringing them to such a critical mission?\\n15. There is no dearth of useless and irritating details. It was so irritating to know how brilliantly Hanumaan could wistle.\\n\\nThe last part of the book was a bit better, but that is no reason to read this book. If you are a fan of Amish Tripathi, do not read this book.'],\n",

       "  'I expected a frivolous romance novel, but I must say this one surprised me.\\n\\nThe story is about Lily Bloom, who grew up in a household where her father physically and sexually abused her mother. In spite of the abuse, Lily’s mother doesn’t leave her husband, which leads Lily to believe her mother is weak, and Lily swears never to end up like her.\\n\\nAs an adult, Lily meets a neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid – he is charming, loving and committed. But over time, Lily discovers a side to him that brings her dangerously close to repeating her mother’s cycle.\\n\\nAfter reading this book I was confused as to how I felt about it. On one hand, there is a clear depth to it; the book talks about abusive relationships in a raw, vulnerable way that makes you think about the mental and emotional trauma involved, as well as the complexity of such relationships.\\n\\nOn the other hand, there is also a lot of what I see as juvenile romance – irrational, childish expectations from relationships, overflowing emotion, tantrums, rapid switches between extreme highs and lows, and levels of drama that no rational adult would ever subject themselves to.\\n\\nI also struggled with Ryle’s character in the early stages of their relationship. In the beginning of the book, he goes to great pains to emphasise how much he hates relationships (which in itself is no sin), and yet the second he meets Lily his entire personality flips and suddenly he is willing to do anything to be with her – and once that happens, he is the sickeningly sweet picture of an overly devoted boyfriend who wants to spend every moment complimenting his girlfriend and wanting to have babies. What brought about this drastic change?? Honestly, I found this transformation hard to believe.\\n\\nAfter reading the book, my aversion to romance novels remains unchanged, but I did find myself feeling much more empathy for victims of domestic abuse – the author’s own experience in an abusive home lends so much more authenticity to the experiences her characters go through – I witnessed how our tendency to judge people who go back to their abusers might not always be warranted, for although it seems black and white, the complexity of abusive relationships is not easy to navigate. There are several reasons why one might go back to them without being weak or brainwashed, and I myself have become far more sympathetic to the need to listen and understand before making assumptions and judging someone who is in that same position.',\n",

Work and pay bills, use dental floss and get to meetings on time, stand in line and fill out forms, come to grips with cables and put furniture together, change tires on the car and charge the phone and switch the coffee machine off and not forget to sign the kids up for swimming lessons. We open our eyes in the morning and life is just waiting to tip a fresh avalanche of “Don’t Forget!”s and “Remember!”s over us. We don’t have time to think or breathe, we just wake up and start digging through the heap, because there will be another one dumped on us tomorrow. We look around occasionally, at our place of work or at parents’ meetings or out in the street, and realize with horror that everyone else seems to know exactly what they’re doing. We’re the only ones who have to pretend. Everyone else can afford stuff and has a handle on other stuff and enough energy to deal with even more stuff. And everyone else’s children can swim.”\\n\\n‘Anxious People’ is a brilliant book. It will make you laugh out loud, it will make you sad and it will make you sigh.

       "  'This book is written by Jeff Keller who is a motivational speaker, which is evident through the motivational tone of the book. After graduating from law school in 1980, he practiced for a few years. Feeling unhappy with his career in law, he became a motivational speaker which he felt was his true calling. The numerous examples of people who achieved their goals through positive attitude are from his personal experience and research\\n\\nWhat do I like about this book?\\n- The overall motivational tone of the book, that creates a positive drive within yourself\\n- To-the-point crisp writing, without being verbose at all (unlike some other books which keep reiterating the same points through multiple pages)\\n- Powerful examples from history\\n- Great quotes by famous men. It is just a treat to read all these famous words by eminent people.\\n- The book justifies its title ‘Attitude is everything’ through its content.\\n\\nWhat I did not like about the book?\\nWell, honestly, NOTHING. I’m usually critical of books if I find any flaws with the writing, or content, or engagement, but I didn’t find anything lacking in this one. Hence, the complete five stars. The book is beautifully written with meaningful content.\\n\\nThe book begins with a famous quote by Thomas Jefferson – “Nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal; nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude.” In the first chapter, Jeff Keller talks about his own circumstances that led to his career change, finally becoming a motivational speaker. He mentions general problems faced by common people in their day to day lives and hence creates a bond with the reader.\\n\\nThe book is primarily divided into 3 parts and 12 lessons. Each part includes various lessons, which are thought-provoking. The basic message conveyed through these three parts and lessons is – “When you THINK, SPEAK, and ACT in ways that support your success, you’re firing on all cylinders and on the way to achieving phenomenal results in your life.”\\n\\nPART 1 – SUCCESS BEGINS IN THE MIND: THINKING\\nIn this part, the author tries to teach us that success begins in the mind, and he focuses on the power of attitude and belief in shaping your destiny.\\n\\nLesson 1 – Your Attitude is your window to the world.\\nAttitude is like a mental filter through which you experience the world around you. Some people see the world through a filter of optimism while others have a more pessimist outlook. A person with positive attitude thinks ‘I CAN’ while the others think ‘I CAN’T’. We all start off with a clean window when we are young, and as we grow old, life throws some dirt on the window (like criticism, ridicule from peers, rejections, disappointments), and we start doubting our capabilities, we start having negative outlook towards thinks, and we are not as confident as we used to be earlier. The advice given in the lesson is to wash our mental window, so we can control our mental attitude. Every human being has the power to choose his attitude. Every human being has the power to choose his/her reactions to different things happening all around.\\nOne of the many Examples cited – Dr. Viktor Frankl’s (Author of Man’s Search for Meaning – would recommend people to read this) experiences during concentration camp.\\n\\nLesson 2 – You are a human magnet.\\nThe message of this lesson can be summed up in a single quote by Earl Nightingale – “We become what we think about.” Jeff states the idea of ‘dominant thought’. He says, your dominant thoughts rule the day. Your beliefs brought you to where you are today, and your thinking from this point forward will take you where you will be in the future. As human magnets, we have the power to attract success through our thoughts. If you think about positive things, positive outcomes, success – same shall follow. However, he rightly warns against the expectation of overnight success too.\\n\\nLesson 3 – Picture your way to success.\\nThe author asks the readers to create mental movies in the mind, picturing things and milestones they wished to achieve. At the same time, we have to get rid of our old rubbish mental images, which remind us of failure, negativity, and disappointments.\\nOne of the many Examples cited – Story of singer Celine Dion where she mentions that from the age of five, she had always imagined singing in front of houseful audience, receiving multiple awards and becoming a superstar. Another example quoted is of Jim Carrey, who wrote a post-dated cheque to himself for $10 Million, which acted as a source of inspiration for him.\\n\\nLesson 4 - Make A Commitment And You Will Move Mountains.\\nJeff mentions the book ‘The ultimate secret to getting absolutely everything you want’ by Mike Hemaki. He says, the key to getting what you want is the ‘willingness to do whatever it takes’ to accomplish your goals. When you commit to something, positive events start happening, the whole universe conspires to make it happen.\\nHe gives the example of Benjamin Roll who cleared the bar council exam in his 14th attempt at the age of 74! Another example cited is that of ‘Baldacci’ who became a writer, by learning the craft of writing, through sheer commitment.\\n\\nLesson 5 - Turn Your Problems Into Opportunities.\\nWhenever something goes wrong, we start questioning ourselves, our circumstances and at times our luck. In such a situation, we have two choices – 1. Keep feeling miserable or 2. Learn a lesson from the problem and move on. A problem should be seen as an opportunity to learn, improve, and do something better next time. Adversity encourages us to make necessary changes in our life, tap our hidden potential. It teaches us to be grateful for the small things and helps us build self-esteem and confidence.\\nAs Napolean said, “Every adversity carries with it the seed of an equivalent or greater benefit.”\\n\\nPART 2 – WATCH YOUR WORDS: SPEAKING\\nIn this part, the author focuses on what we speak. What we say, directly shows how we think, and precedes our actions.\\n\\nLesson 6 – Your Worlds Blaze A Trails.\\nThe author says that words have immense power. They can build your future, destroy opportunities or help maintain the status quo. Your choice of words defines your personality.\\nAlways remember – Thoughts > Words > Beliefs > Actions > Results\\nThe author cites an inspirational example of Kent Cullers, a scientist at NASA.\\n\\nLesson 7 – How are you?\\nJeff says that this question is the most frequently asked questions to any person, and what reply a person gives to this question is extremely important. Now, a reply to this question can be – Positive, Mediocre or Negative. We should avoid negative answers as they drain the energy of others as well. Jeff says that we should always reply to this question with words such as ‘Terrific’ or ‘Great’ or other such positive words. This will help boost our confidence and create a positive outlook.\\n\\nLesson 8 – Stop complaining.\\nNobody wants to hear about our pains and problems. As William Penn said, “the secret of happiness is to count your blessings while others are adding up their troubles.” Jeff says that complaining is a major problem in all of us, whereas it doesn’t help anyone. It doesn’t help the person ranting about his problems, and definitely doesn’t help the listener who’s least interested in listening to someone else’s problems when he has plenty of his own. However, at the same time, the author clarifies that sharing your problems with your nearest ones, is different from complaining, and rightly so.\\n\\nPART 3 – HEAVEN HELPS THOSE WHO ACT: ACTION\\nIn this part, the author emphasizes on the fact that without action, positive thoughts and words will not help you attain the level of success you aimed for.\\n\\nLesson 9 - Associate with Positive People.\\nWe are the average of the people we spend our most time with. The people you hang out with define your outlook and future because they greatly influence our thoughts and life. Hence, it is very important to be in the company of positive people, who have definite goals for themselves. Hanging around folks with no ambition or goals, who imbibe negativity in you, will put you on the path of failure.\\n\\nLesson 10 - Confront Your Fears and Grow.\\nThe path that leads to success is often filled with obstacles. The people who succeed, do so by overcoming these obstacles. If you want to achieve something, you have to get out of your ‘comfort zone’. You have to stretch yourself. Adopt a mindset that helps you acquire what you want. Remember, repetition is the key, like any other muscle. It will build up and encourage you to do something great.\\n\\nLesson 11 – Get out there and fail.\\nWinston Churchill said, - “Success is going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.” In order to success someday, you must be willing to fail today. Successful people around the world are wise enough to know that success doesn’t come in one shot. You have pe persevere, fail again and again, learn from your failures, and work on it again with double enthusiasm.\\nThe author cites an example of TV talk show host ‘Sally Jessy Raphael’, who was fired 18 times, couldn’t pay her credit card bills for 26 years, lived on food stamps, before finally making it big in the industry.\\n\\nLesson 12 - Networking That Gets Results.\\nThis lesson shows the importance of teamwork. It shows, if you’re positive and ready to help people, people, in turn, will go out of their way to help you back. Some key points from this lesson –\\n- Develop a win-win attitude.\\n- Effectively participate in a group or organization.\\n- Do not stop the flow of messages, you should keep in touch with your peers.\\n- Become a good listener.\\n- Congratulate people on for their accomplishment.\\n- Make new friends in your field.\\n- Do more for others, before expecting something in return.\\n\\nIn my opinion, this is one of the best self-improvement books ever written. The content of this book far outweighs its price, and although I have provided the summary for a quick glance, you can still go ahead and pick the book for a quick read. There are many more powerful impactful examples cited throughout the book which make this one an interesting read. Recommended!\\n\\nFavorite Quotes from the book:\\n- “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way…. Even though conditions such as lack of sleep, insufficient food, and various mental stresses may suggest that the inmates were bound to react in certain ways, in the final analysis, it becomes clear that the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision and not the result of camp influences alone.”\\n- “When you believe you can do something, you have the courage to move forward despite being afraid.”\\n- “As adults, most of us become a lot more concerned about the opinions of others, often hesitating because people may laugh at us or criticize us. At the age of six, we knew we had to fall.”\\n- “Whether you think you can—or think you can’t—you’re right!” – Henry Ford\\n- “You see, when you change your attitude, sparks fly in the universe. You’re energized. You begin to see new possibilities. You move into action. You achieve extraordinary results. That’s why I say when you change your attitude, you change your life!”\\n- “What the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve.”\\n- “They can because they think they can.” – Virgil',\n",

       "  'I kind of want to cut this book in half, praise the first part, and stick the second part in some corner to gather dust. Not that the second part is bad, mind you; the entire book is well-written and obviously the product of someone who knows their field. There’s just a lot of it. Thinking, Fast and Slow is kind of like a guest who shows up to your party and then dazzles everyone with an impromptu, 15-minute oration on the geopolitical situation in South Ossetia; and, everyone applauds and turns to go back to their own conversations, only for the guest to launch into another story about the time they parachuted into the Balkans to break up a nascent civil war, a story which is followed quickly by a similar tale of a visit to Southeast Asia…. Well, I think you catch my drift. Daniel Kahneman spins an interesting tale of human psychology and the way our brains interpret and act on data. But the book overstays its welcome by a few hundred pages.\\n\\nKahneman’s thesis breaks our decision-making systems into two pieces, System 1 and System 2, which are the respective “fast” and “slow” of the title. System 1 provides intuitive judgements based on stimulus we might not even be conscious of receiving; it’s the snap signals that we might not even know we are acting upon. System 2 is the more contemplative, cognitively taxing counterpart that we engage for serious mental exertion. Though often oppositional in the types of decisions they produce, Kahneman is keen to emphasize that it’s not about System 1 versus System 2. Instead, he’s out to educate us about how the interplay between these systems causes us to make decisions that aren’t always rational or sensible given the statistics and evidence at hand.\\n\\nKahneman takes us through an exhaustive tour of biases and fallacies people are prone to making. He talks about the halo effect, affection bias, confirmation bias, and even regression to the mean. As a mathematician, I liked his angle on probability and statistics; as a logician, I appreciated his brief segues into the logical aspects of our contradictory decision-making processes. Lest I give the impression Kahneman gets too technical, however, I should emphasize that, despite its length, Thinking, Fast and Slow remains aggressively accessible. There are a few points where, if you don’t have a basic grasp of probability (and if Kahneman demonstrates anything, it’s that most people don’t), then you might feel talked over (or maybe it’s those less-than-infrequent, casual mentions of “and later I won a Nobel Prize”). But this book isn’t so much about science as it is about people.\\n\\nThere are two other things I really appreciated about this book, both of which are related to psychology. I’m a fairly easygoing person, and I don’t always like to make waves, but sometimes I like to make some trouble and argue with some of my friends about whether psychology is a science. The problem for psychology is that it’s actually a rather broad term for a series of overlapping fields of investigation into human behaviour. On one end of this continuum, you have Freud and Jung and the various psychoanalysts who, let’s face it, are one step up from astrologers and palm-readers. On the other end, you have the cutting-edge cognitive psychology informed by the neuroscience of MRIs, split-brain studies, and rat research. So claiming that psychology is or isn’t a science is a little simplistic, and I’m willing to grant that there are areas within psychology that are science. For what it’s worth, Kahneman went a long way to reinforcing this: it’s clear he and his collaborators have done decades of extensive research. (Now, yes, it’s social science, but I won’t get into that particular snobbery today.)\\n\\nThe other thing I liked about Thinking, Fast and Slow is its failure to mention evolutionary psychology. Once in a while, Kahneman alludes to System 1’s behaviour being the result of evolutionary adaptation—and that’s fine, because it is true, almost tautologically so. But he never quite delves into speculation about why such behaviour evolved, and I appreciate this. There’s a difference between identifying something as an adaptation and determining why it’s an adaptation, and I’m not a fan of evolutionary psychologists’ attempts to reduce everything to the trauma of trading trees for bipedalism … I’m willing to admit I have an ape brain, but culture must count for something, hmm?\\n\\nI suppose it’s also worth mentioning that this book reaffirms my supercilious disregard for economics. According to Kahneman, stock brokers and investors have no idea what they are doing—and some of them know this, but most of them don’t. Economists are, for the most part, highly-trained, but they seem bent upon sustaining this theoretical fantasy land in which humans are rational creatures. Aristotle aside, the data seem to say it isn’t so. I occasionally try my hand at reading books about the economy, just so I can say I did, but they usually end up going over my head. I’m a mathematician and I don’t get numbers—but at least I’m not the only one.\\n\\nSo Thinking, Fast and Slow is genuinely interesting. I learned a lot from it. I would rate it higher, but I was starting to flag as I approached the finish line. Truth be told, I skipped the two articles Kahneman includes at the end that were the original publications about the theories he explains in the book. I’m sure they are fascinating for someone with more stamina, but at that point I just wanted to be done. That’s never good: one of the responsibilities of a non-fiction author is to know how to pace a book and keep its length appropriate. Too short and the book is unsatisfying—too long, and maybe it’s more so. And I think this flaw is entirely avoidable; it’s a result of Kahneman’s tendency to reiterate, to circle back around to the same discussions over and over again. He spends an entire chapter on prospect theory, then a few chapters later he’s telling us about its genesis all over again, just from a slightly different angle. Like that party guest, Kahneman is full of interesting stories, but after telling one after another for such a long period of time, it starts sounding like white noise. And he ate all those little cocktail snacks too.\\n\\nI inevitably ended up comparing Thinking, Fast and Slow to How We Decide, a much slimmer volume along much the same lines as this one. Whereas Lehrer’s focus is on the neurology behind decision-making, Kahneman is more interested in psychology. Both books boil down to we suck at automatic decision-making when statistics are involved; therefore, we behave less rationally than we believe we do. Lehrer explains why things go wrong, and Kahneman categorizes all the different way things go wrong. In many ways the books are complementary, and if this is an area of interest for you, I’ll recommend them both. For the casual reader, however, Thinking, Fast and Slow is a rather dense meal. By all means, give it a try, but take it slow.',\n",
       "  \"The author explain how we makes judgements using System 1 and System 2 brain. I like the parts where author explained how our decisions go wrong and what caused these ( most of the time they happened because of unknowingly using System 1).\\n\\nThe downside is it's too long to read.\",\n",

       "  \"Take it slow. If you are going to want to understand and find this book helpful then have an open mind it's not just with this book but especially books such as these that give meaning to human existence and challenge certain ideologies by getting and understanding them at their core.\\n\\nLet me put it in simple words. This book can change your life and make you question things at their core(not everyone) to understand and put them in the proper perspective. The subjective reality that we live in(inside our very own brains) and the notion of fighting for it makes no sense beyond our beliefs and the change it's going to bring to our objective reality, of course, that doesn't mean that you have to kill your beliefs and do whatever you like. That's not real life, is it? It's really odd when we go deep, we can't try and catch on to something there because it's mostly empty or at least we don't see it yet. This book brought me some deep-rooted pain.\\n\\nAware! People who are swinging their moods by questioning whether a supernatural creator exist can get a real kick in the head there so take it slow!\",\n",
       "  'I tend to think of this book as a prequel to “Homo Deus,” simply because I happened to read them in the wrong order! In fact, “Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind” was written several years before “Homo Deus: A History of Tomorrow.”\\n\\nYuval Noah Harari, the author, is a professor of History and an intellectual polymath in the tradition of Bronowski, Issac Asimov and Carl Sagan. He has written several path-breaking books during the past ten years.\\n\\nThis book is a sweeping dissertation on the history of mankind. On the very first page, we are told about the conceptual sequence of physics, chemistry, biology and history. Next, the author lists the three revolutions which have shaped the course of history: The Cognitive Revolution, the Agricultural Revolution and the Scientific Revolution. The book is divided into four sections, one for each of the three Revolutions and one serving as a bridge between the Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. Let us examine these sections one by one.\\n\\nThe section on the Cognitive Revolution begins with a “disturbing secret” – for a long time, Homo Sapiens was not the only human species. In the author’s own words, “The earth of a hundred millennia ago was walked by at least six different species of man.” The author says that more than one human species had learnt the use of fire. Homo Sapiens originated in East Africa and entered Eurasia through the Arabian Peninsula about 70,000 years ago. There are two conflicting theories about the interaction between Sapiens and the other species, known as the Interbreeding Theory and the Replacement Theory. The author speculates that the truth lies in between these two theories, although there is a strong likelihood that violence and genocide had occurred, as “Tolerance is not a Sapiens trademark.”\\n\\nThe Cognitive Revolution comprises new ways of thinking and communicating, which arose between 70,000 and 30,000 years ago. Sapiens bonded with “gossip” and formed bands with upto 150 members. Beyond this limit, says the author, human cooperation becomes possible only through common myths, or imagined reality, leading to trade and cultural evolution.\\n\\nFurther, “The wandering bands of storytelling Sapiens were the most important and most destructive force the animal kingdom had ever produced… The settlers of Australia, or more accurately, its conquerors, didn’t just adapt, they transformed the Australian ecosystem beyond recognition.” The combination of climate change and human hunting changed not only Australia, but also Siberia, North America and South America.\\n\\nComing to the next Revolution, agriculture began around 9500 – 8500 BC in south eastern Turkey, and simultaneously in other parts of the globe as well. The author surprisingly describes Agriculture as “history’s biggest fraud” and justifies it by saying that “the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return.” As the population increased and animals were domesticated, the possibility of returning to a foraging lifestyle diminished. Rearing of animals involved (and still involves) extreme cruelty. Eventually, as trade began and data arose, some rudimentary forms of writing began. Next, hierarchies came up based on imagined orders. Simultaneously, gender discrimination arose in various societies.\\n\\nThe third section of the book is titled “Unification of Mankind,” which covers human culture. The author identifies three universal orders: economic, or the monetary order; political, or the imperial order; and finally, religious order exemplified by religions such as Buddhism, Christianity and Islam. There are detailed chapters on each of these.\\n\\nThe fourth and last section of the book covers the Scientific Revolution. Beginning with the philosophical aspects of ignorance and the scientific temperament, the author presents another striking line of thought: “The feedback loop between science, empire and capital has arguably been history’s chief engine for the past 500 years.” The next few chapters are devoted to these topics. Subsequently, the author discusses the Industrial Revolution, along with energy, mass production and the social impact of technology. This is followed by a chapter focusing on the relationship between prosperity and happiness, followed by some speculations about the future.\\n\\nThere can be no doubt that this book is a tour de force, which compels the reader to think. However, various criticisms can be levelled against Dr Harari. The foremost of these is that many speculations, theories and opinions of the author are presented as established facts. The other major potential for criticism lies in the selection of material and the relative emphasis on various topics. This reviewer, for example, feels that most of the chapters in the third and fourth sections of the book are too long and verbose.\\n\\nI cannot end this review without comparing this book with the author’s subsequent work “Homo Deus,” which I happened to read first. There is considerable overlap between the topics covered in the two books. The speculations about the past in this book are mirrored by speculations about the future in the other book. But there is an important difference: while this book leaves the reader with a sense of shame for belonging to Homo Sapiens, the other one gives hope that someday there will be a sense of pride arising out of being human. Finally, if one had to choose to read only one of these two books, I would unequivocally recommend “Homo Deus.”'],\n",

       "  'Amid a hectic lifestyle, where you hardly get time for yourself, I finally decided to purchase Amazon Kindle and resume my long-lost habit of reading for once and this was listed as the most recommended book so I thought to give it a try and I am glad that I did because it rekindled the excitement of reading fiction all over again. Talking about this book, it is almost captivating with its thrilling story line and unprecedented, mind-bending twists.\\n\\nHowever, as you progress through the chapters and begin forming a visual of the story and characters, it almost feels like you are watching a movie. Well, this might be a brilliant accomplishment for certain beginner fiction writers, however, some readers like me would instantly realise that it feels less like a book and more like a movie screenplay, which makes it slightly less desirable. A book can still be enjoyable if there are more elements in it which makes it tilt more towards a book rather than a screenplay. And when I found out, once I finished reading the book, that the author had a been a professional screenwriter, I was not surprised.\\n\\nNevertheless, I would give full credit to the author, who despite having written his first book, leveraged his screenwriting faculties to portray his story and augment the desirability of his book. Conclusively, this is a must read if you are into crime thrillers or thrillers in general.',\n",
       "  '***MILD SPOILERS AHEAD***\\n\\nThe Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides was the first of the many that brought me into the world of crime, murder mysteries especially. A psychological thriller, a classic whydunnit I’d call it. Although I am not a huge fan of books that screw my mind (I believe that I have just a tiny bit of my mind left handling a toddler and I’d rather save it) this book came with rave reviews and I made an exception, just to break out of my comfort zone. I was highly skeptical, you know. I had stopped picking up books on impulse since I realized my time is precious (toddler again) and I will get only so much time to read (read give up my sleep and read) So I better make choices that I wouldn’t regret. So, did I? I wouldn’t say this review would be an entirely positive one, but it will have those points as well which I thought gives less credibility to this otherwise super debut novel.\\n\\nPsychotherapist Theo Faber takes up a job, or better say worms his way in, at The Grove, a facility for dangerous convicts. Why leave his comfortable job elsewhere and come to the sinking ship that this institution is? The reason is the artist, Alicia Berenson. A high profile resident convict of The Grove who has been convicted in an open-and-shut case of murdering her husband, 5 bullets in the man and she, in behind the bars. What’s so strange about the case that brings Theo to her after 6 years of the crime is that she hasn’t spoken a word since, either in her defense or against it. Theo believes he would be able to break the walls that Alicia has built around herself and get the truth out of her mouth, whatever that may be. With Theo now treating Alicia in the hopes of a breakthrough, what proceeds gives a new perspective to the entire case. Emotions are expressed and behavioral changes are presented by Alicia in a manner that no one could believe. As Theo digs deeper into the past, he realizes the truth is much deeply embedded than just the day of the crime which Alicia has committed.\\n\\nWritten in parts, the story is told from the POV of both Theo and Alicia. While Alicia keeps a diary, Theo’s parts are more conversational, he and his wife and he and Alicia. Frankly, the chapters with his wife bored me to death and I considered putting the books down several times wondering what the hell, why is the wife in the midst of all this when apparently she doesn’t have anything of value to add to the book except several extra pages of inconsequential matter? But what I didn’t know, pardon me, I am a novice in thriller/crime, was that in a genre like this, nothing is neglected. What is written must be relevant somehow, somewhere. The complexity of Michaelides’ story is revealed only at the end, the sheer amount of work that must have gone into building the characters and then laying them bare for the reader by delving deep into their psyches is enthralling. The gradual release of Alicia’s miseries is mirrored by that of Theo’s. Both the primary characters have dark secrets to guard, and it is in the company of each other that they open up and let the reader in.\\nFrom what I know about psychological thrillers, they are usually the playground for the author where the reader is just a spectator. Both the teams are the author himself, he kicks, he saves; he hits, he catches; what he shows is what we see most of the time. Unless we are someone belonging to the super reader category and able to read between the lines or guess accurately, it is highly unlikely that we will be able to see through the author’s fib. In this book, the author resorts to the same method as mentioned above, masking facts only to reveal them later and leave the reader on her knees with the carpet-pull effect. I am not saying I disliked the book, in fact, I liked it so much that I dived headfirst into the genre, but it does have its misgivings, the foremost being Theo’s desperate attempt at silencing Alicia. Even if she would have spoken, who would have believed a convicted murderer who hasn’t spoken for 6 years and is considered almost senile? There are a few other tidbits that put me off, like Theo’s relationship with his wife, his eagerness to treat Alicia, and most importantly, the misgivings about the timeline.\\nDespite all of the above-mentioned irregularities, I enjoyed reading the book. I had a lot to take away from it. The issues around mental illness and its acceptance, or lack of it, by the patient and the ones around them even today, is heart-wrenching. What must be treated like any other disease, is left to fend for itself which often gives way to dire consequences. Of all the times, now is the most critical of all to acknowledge, understand, and lend an ear to those who suffer silently.',\n",

       "  \"Hare krsna\\nI have seen many people saying this book claims that women are inferior.I myself a vaishya (businessman)and in some photos he has shown photos that women businessman and sudras (workers who work for gratifying the senses)cannot understand Vedas buy by the grace of the Lord we can understand his science by reading gita and bhagvatam. There is practical reason behind this. We business man don't have time to read 4 Vedas and that to under a guru if you are a businessman you will know.And women also didn't have time to read it in vedic age because they were housemakers they had to make food decorate the house recieve the guests help and care the child and gratify their husbands.They also had a busy schedule. And the sudras or workers(people who work not for the highest goal which is supreme lord but to gratify their sense)if you have worked in a office being completely not indulged in spiritual activities you will know you don't have time to read Vedas .Thus all these false allegations are clarified. But how can we understand geet let me tell you if you read the only 10 pages per day you will finish it in 80 days excluding the introduction and outro sanskrit shlokas and their relationship of who is whose relative and other stuff which is given in the last pages not that important you can do it that 10 page per day don't take a lot of time .But for Vedas you need guru and where will you get nice guru in kaliyug .And geeta also we read under guru but the purports in this book are there to guide us like a guru who is shrila Prabhupad.Stop spreading false propaganda against Srila Prabhupad and iskcon. And regarding page 657 or 656 the purport is slightly misleading but it can be solved very easily. Just like we man have role in the society women in vedic times were the housemakers they decorate stuff. Make food gratify their husbands take care of their children and give them sanskar. They are bound to not do something but we all have roles and they perform that role you are creating inferiority complex because people now say that mom who are housemakers are dihati or backward but the mother who goes to office has not time for cooking and caring their child .But we don't see that and that in turn will lead to behavioural issues in child which no one speaks of and also stays I office whole day when will they give time to their child? And regarding one more pic where material nature of energy of Lord is called inferior let me explain. The base tattva of this God science is acityabhedabhed means continously different and etc not different. Iskcon is a gaudiya vaishnav community whose main deity is radha not krsna although it might seem so krsna is .They worship krnsa because radha loves him. And yes she is considered which you will know when you join iskcon and go there and ask .And let me give and please like I have muscular energy or calories in my body I control it right but without it will I function if I don't have enough calories in my body or simply energy derived from food. So as it applies in God krsna's main potency is ahladinni and other are incomplete yet they are given full respect and yet they are inferior to hladinni who is radha. Material nature is maya and it given equal respect but yet it is inferior and we belong to higher energy called hladinni or radha we are her parts and parcels and since krsna idol non different than radha so we are his parts and parcels. As I mentioned about acityabhedabhed she is given respect and yet she is lower energy. Read krsna the supreme personality of godhead it is the book from the same author there in energy section of Krsna the writer himself says both energies are given equal respect. If it's given don't have muscular energy will I move no and muscular energy is there but I am bot there so it can't function nature also can't function automatically it is controlled. If you draw a life like rose you have to invest a lot of intellect and time. So how can you conclude the universe is independent and it created itself some scientists also not believe in big bang theory now they allure ng new theory . Similarly my wife cannot give birth to child until my sperm goes inside is not independent in that way in same way the material nature is dependent on lord for creation. And it's inferior energy because it is not complete manifeatatiom of Lord's energy but hladinni is superior because she is compete manifestation of Lord's energy not half. Don't be fool analyse the situation then react. The Lord complete energy is nothing without him and the Lord is nothing without his complete energy.\",\n",

IT DOES NOT INTENT TO HURT ANYONE’S FEELINGS, AND DOES NOT MEANT TO COMPARE WITH ANY OTHER REVIEWER’S FEELINGS.\\nWell writing a review for this kind of extraordinary book is a big audacity for me. however here I’m, trying to give some brief review of the book.\\n\\nThe book is basically divided into three parts, the first one describes the way the Jews prisoners were treated in the Nazi Concentration Camps and how their lifestyle was. In the second part, the author described the basics of Logotherapy, a way of treatment of the Psychotherapeutic Patients. And finally, in the third part, he described what he actually meant by Man’s Search for meaning.\\n\\nBeing a Jew, the author was transferred to the Auschwitz, Dachau and other concentration camps during the Nazi occupation in Austria. Here, in the first part of the book, the author described his days in those concentration camps, where is were no chance of seeing the morning sun in the next day. And this happened every day. He described the way the SS guards used to treat the prisoners, the corruption prevailed in the camps, the malnutrition, the lifestyle of the camp Jews etc. The way he described the tortures the prisoners suffered, would surely bring tears to your eyes. During his description, he also pointed out the psychological condition of the other comrades in those camps. When most of the prisoners lost all hope of his life, some of them still kept the faith, that good days were coming.\\n\\nIn the second part, the author basically described the Logotherapy Techniques. And the most interesting part of the book is the third part. Here the author describes “Man’s search for meaning”. We, the human beings on this planet are living for a purpose. Until & unless we can’t find the purpose of our life, there is no reason for us to be here alive. Most of the prisoners in the camps lost all of their hopes and then died because they lost their purpose, as per the author. It is a must-read book for all I think.\\n\\nThe book also consists of few life-changing quotes which I liked in the book and would like to share:\\n\\n1. For success, like happiness, can’t be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one’s dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one’s surrender to a person other than oneself.\\n\\n2. There are things which must cause you to lose your reason or you have none to lose.\\n\\n3. Suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great of little. Therefore the ‘size’ of human suffering is absolutely relative.\\n\\n4. No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar situation he might not have done the same.\\n\\n5. The human being is completely and unavoidably influenced by his surroundings.\\n\\n6. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death, human life can’t be completed\\n\\n7. Emotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it.\\n\\n8. There is no need to be ashamed of tears, for tears bore witness that a man had the greatest of courage, the courage to suffer.\\n\\n9. A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears toward a human who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life. He knows the “why” for his existence, and will be able to bear almost any ” how”.\\n\\n10. The body has fewer inhibitions than the mind.\\n\\n11. No one has the right to do wrong, not even if wrong has been done to them.',\n",
       "  'OMG! It’s a good knowledgeable and yet thrilling book. I have not come across any such book with combination of these two aspects together in one book.\\n\\nSo, here is the summary & take away from this thrilling story.\\n\\nThe author was a neurologist and psychiatrist. So, by education he knew technical brain anatomy (being neurologist) as well as logical and emotional aspects of human behavior with respect to the brain functioning (being psychiatrist). He spent 3 years in various concentration camps which were basically prisons where Nazis (hitter’s army) used to keep potential threat like prisoner of wars and Jewish during holocaust in 1940 (somewhat during second world war).\\n\\nThe book is a journey of the author’s surviving in various camps during his 3 years tenure where he went through immense physical torture, hyper anxiety, inhumane living conditions, insufficient food and unhealthy environment of deadly diseases. The details on tortures were so horrifying that they will give you goosebumps by imagining how humanely it was impossible to bear such pain. The life of prisoner was only a number (a number was printed on everyone’s body) for guards and they looked for every possible opportunity to torture and kill prisoners.\\n\\nAt various instances he explained the two aspects of feeling in one scenario where a person is feeling horrified and blessed at the same time. For instance, once few people along with him were standing bare feet in snow for 8 hours straight in one of the camp they were recently transferred and due to frostbite on their foot there was immense pain but at the same time they were happy as standing outside in snow they observed that there was no chimney in the camp (chimney showed that there were gas chambers in camp where prisoners were burned alive). Another instance he talked is that one day they were getting transferred in a train and everyone was anxious that they were getting shifted to a death camp where all of them will be killed yet they happy to see outside scenery after a long time from small holes in train.\\n\\nAuthor explained that there are various mental stages a person goes through in such camp and at the last stage he becomes numb to death. Imagine that a person is so much scared for a long time that he doesn’t feel scared anymore. His emotional imbalance causes various types of behavioral changes which ultimately makes him inhumane emotionally, after all emotions are something which makes a man different from other living creatures.\\n\\nNow, here to avoid going into the last mental stage where the person gives up the hope to live and dies author explains the ways or tips using which he survived and as well as he help few among himself survive. The first tip is, let me quote exactly what he mentioned in the book is “He who has ‘WHY’ to live, can bear with almost any ‘HOW’. So basically, he explained that if a person has a reason and hope to survive and sees a logical ending to these sufferings will be able to survive. Let me try to explain the reason he has referred here, there were two people in the camp who gave up the hope and wanted to commit suicide author asked few questions to them which made them realize that what reason they must live for. One person had a small kid which would be waiting for him in some other country, so he realized that one day he might have chance to go and live with his kid. Another person had an unfinished script which only he could complete on which he was working from a very long time before he was captured and sent this camp, so he realized that one day he will get freedom and will complete his pending script.\\n\\nAnother point to note in above mentioned instance is the reason or hope to live can be anything, it may be a personal matter to you, another human in your life or a thing also. He said “A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears towards other human who affectionately waits for him or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw his life as he knows the WHY for this life & existence and hence will be able to bear with almost any HOW”.\\n\\nHe also talked about stimulus and response control which I think was better explained by Steven covey in his book. But one of the quote he put in the book was worth mentioning that “everything can be taken from a man but one thing, and that is one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances”.\\n\\nLastly, he talked about happiness where he says that “happiness cannot be pursued but ensued”. The happiness is internal, and its means changes time to time, situation to situation, to person to person and like there cannot be a standardize rule to happiness like next movement in a game of chess as movement will be specifically based on current position of other players chess components (hope you understand what I mean). Happiness comes in alignment with your core values in life and which is why it changes time to time, person to person.\\n\\nWhat I did not like about the book is that there were disconnection in the story he narrated and the journey in camp is not in proper sequence, he only explained some random days and instances which sometime become irritating and disappointing. I understand that the prime purpose of the book was not to take the reader through the day by day, event by event his tenure in camp, but it is to only to use such events of the camp as context to explain the point he is trying to make about human behavior. But I felt that it would have been a very great story of his survival to go through day by day in detail.\\n\\n4 out of 5. So, what’s your meaning of life at this moment in this phase of your life…...? Think about it.',\n",

       "  'Rajeev Malhotra is a US-based entrepreneur, who has made it his life’s mission to analyse how US academia thinks of India and its Hindu culture. His basic thesis is that Hindu culture and philosophical traditions have been maliciously short-charged by US scholars, and this needs to be countered.He famously got into a spat with Wendy Doniger over her interpretation of Hindu mythology. He has built up a large following of acolytes, and of detractors. Therefore, whether you agree or disagree with his views, you can not ignore them.\\n\\nHe has written several books on this theme, including a book called ‘Breaking India’ some ten years ago. This book which was not an easy read, primarily because of the rambling nature of the arguments, led to the coining of a somewhat unusual term ‘Breaking India Forces’: a miscellaneous grouping of Marxist intellectuals, ‘pseudo-seculars’, ‘foreign-funded NGOs’, missionaries, and generally anyone who was disparaging of Hindu culture. The book has had an enormous influence on social media activists and may have contributed to the immense legislative and social pressure that NGOs are facing in India. There is a marked improvement in the flow of Mr Malhotra’s writing in this second book as compared to the first book ‘Breaking India 1.0.’\\n\\nThe book ratchets up the pressure on civil society further by updating the thesis. The argument now focuses on how Critical Race Theory (CRT) of US has been applied ‘mindlessly’ to Indian situation by the Left, as Critical Caste Theory (CCT). The objective is to keep India down in the same way as the Aryan invasion theory and imported concepts of caste changed India’s politics for a hundred years. Mr Malhotra is careful to acknowledge the basic logic of CRT in the US situation, while contesting its transformation and application to India as CCT.\\n\\nMr Malhotra’s narrative goes on to argue that in order to do so, Harvard University, has deliberately marshalled the wealth and energy of well-known Indian industrialists who are unwittingly giving away their money to Left wing causes (disguised as social justice). The book mentions names of many NGOs, donor agencies as well Universities which are allegedly complicit in this project of the Leftists based in USA. These include Ashoka University, Omidyar Network, J-PAL, Godrej group, Azim Premji group, IPSMF, among several others.\\n\\nSome of Mr Malhotra’s arguments make sense from the perspective of practising Hindus (and Christians, Jews, Muslims as well), who perhaps just want to be left alone, and resent the often pointless criticism unleashed by American academia as a kind of intellectual Buzkashi. This sentiment has been expressed rather forcefully in another (deeply disturbing) book titled ‘Invading the Sacred’, to which Mr Malhotra also contributed.\\n\\nOver the years, American academia and publishing industry has developed immense soft power because of their industriousness. You will often see how Indian politicians pathetically crave for recognition by US or Western media, even when they emphatically espouse Swadeshi. So while the influence of anything Amareekan on Indian elite is undeniable, most people are unlikely to buy Rajeev Malhotra’s thesis of Harvard’s malicious intrusion, simply because it is so outlandish.\\n\\nHowever, it is also likely that the conspiracy angle of his arguments will persuade many Indians and will drive the dialogue, at least for some time, on the social media, and possibly in legislative circles. Some of the entities mentioned in the book have already been facing regulatory scrutiny.\\n\\nThis book is therefore important reading for anyone who wants to understand the perspective of those on the Right, as also get some juicy gossip about the Left. The book is also rather huge, 800 pages, and could be slow reading for many.\\n\\nIt could also be a disturbing experience, as Mr Malhotra feels that he has has his back to the wall, and passes on that feeling to the reader as well!',\n",

       "  'The book is written in a very complicated way but the way i understand it, the author argues for a process of decolonizing whereby removing western influence and returning back to a Hindu-system that, according to the author, seems to have existed forever. In the process, he blames Colonial powers and people in general who are foreign to this idea, for imposing their system and not accepting the system as it was respectively. This then somehow ends up ruining a culture that has always existed, from Temples to Environment in general, all the way back to establishing the Caste-system. To make matters worse, in his imagination, Foreigners even took credit for native contributions such as Democracy!\\n\\nWhat makes this book especially hard to read are the kinds of mental gymnastics the author hoops through to confirm his biases, like answering \"Was league of nations secular?\", he jumps from \"It was Christian\" to “but Vatican was not part because it was the Protestant movement” to “The Protestant US was not part because of American isolationism”, no wonder a reader like myself gets disoriented!\\n\\nAstonishing that there are so many people out there who literally believe in this binary/divisive idea, making it a best-seller! Have we given up on the ideals of Gandhi, truly painful to finish this on the birthday of someone who led to the independence of our country with the idea of Unity in diversity! It has this chilling effect of Mein Kampf whose central message reverbs that the foreign Jews are messing up the native Aryans culture with the help of Liberal minds and that past glory needs to be re-established at the cost of those! There is no denying of Colonial atrocities poignantly summarized like one by Dr Shashi Tharoor MP - Britain Does Owe Reparations, irony is that one can probably replace \"colonial\" with \"upper-caste\" without losing a lot of atrocities! The author seems to be stuck in Iron Age and wants us to go back hopefully with all the technological advances intact. I dont want to go back to Iron Age given modern medical science has single-handedly doubled our life expectancy in just the last century [How was global life expectancy improved since the mid 1900s? | World Economic Forum] not to mention the Internet i am using to write this. I will still give it 3 stars for effortful references and arguments, although cherry-picked and straw-man, respectively.\\n\\nComments outside my formal training or research experience don’t mean much aniways. I am just a medical doctor who best understands bioinformatics and believe a lot of the Answer lies in the Genome. I can’t really comment on what was India, if it’s where Democracy existed first and if so, of what kind but i think probably the author is confusing the present structure of India as a direct continuation of the one in the Bronze age like the Harappan Civilization? That begs the question where is the evidence that we are direct descendants of just that lineage? I can agree that our Genome tells us that we are ALL coming from our ancestors out of Africa but coming to lineage, last i read, there is only one genome sequence from the region, and its profile \"fits as a mixture of people related to ancient Iranians (the largest component) and Southeast Asian hunter-gatherers\" [An Ancient Harappan Genome Lacks Ancestry from Steppe Pastoralists or Iranian Farmers] not to mention that the language is yet to be cracked (there is an awesome app [The Indus Script IM77] if someone wants to) however we have ample evidence on how our language falls nicely into the Indo+European tree, again through Iran! What about the Caste-system, well again the evidence points that \"Indian castes are most likely to be of proto-Asian origin with West Eurasian admixture resulting in rank-related and sex-specific differences\" [Genetic Evidence on the Origins of Indian Caste Populations], not to mention the clear delineation of ANI, not me, well maybe, but the Ancestral North Indians from South (ASI) [Reconstructing Indian population history] which were never part of \"India\" before, not even during our poster-boy Ashoka of Maurya Empire , probably i am missing something?\\n\\nThat being said, I agree with the views of Roy as expressed in the book and as i understood, that Science is what needs to be taught because it teaches you critical thinking unlike anything else! And i believe that it makes us Human. I also do agree with the author on our Culture being closer to Nature like i am not in the favor of promoting Tourism and Development like having Airport in Andaman ironically named after poster-boy of Hintuva-movement! What about different schools of Hinduism itself? What about the Bhakti movement overpowering others and end up solidifying Monotheism! Sorry, i couldn’t refrain from this whataboutery, reminds of Nietsche, fighting a monster one must fear of becoming one!\\n\\nIt’s intriguing how Kant being painted as white-supremacist and one of his core issues seem to be Temple under control of the state which i can empathize with and i really don’t want regressive practices like Sati Pratha making a comeback in name of respect for customs. State and Religion are probably best as separate but I will not venture further into Religion as idea where even card-carrying Anthropologists make basic data-analysis mistakes like ignoring missing-values of traditions! [Critique topples Nature paper on belief in gods]\\n\\nAll that being said, given my Brahmin birth, I can actually feel where it is coming from like our Vedic text has ample racist terms referring to Foreigners like the word Mleccha which is precisely the word my mom still uses referring to downtrodden! Nail-biting to hear more of his understanding, hope on some of the concern on this maybe in the following part of Trilogy?',\n",
       "  'I studied this book and not just read it. I believe the author had painstakingly elucidated sentiments of Sankaracharya Sri Sri Sri Chandrasekhar Sarasvati Swamigal ( Kanchi Mahaperiyava) is reported to have observed back in 1947 “the country may be free but its people are not yet”. Kanchi Mahatma (and such other Mahatmas) walked the length and breadth of Bharat to ensure that the flame of indigeneity is kept alive. One of the strands of this book ‘coloniality’ was/is so ingrained that prompted such a comment leading to such a tapas by Mahaperiyava. Fast forward 75 years, it still holds true and sadly this thread of coloniality has intertwined to become the third strand of our (Bharatiya) DNA. Author in his inimitable style is attempting to surgically remove (at the very least, draw our attention) this alien parasite before it completely devours.\\nAuthor is commended for embarking on this journey to raise the collective consciousness through this trilogy and complementing it with his debates and discussions. The clinical assessment supported by rigorous analysis was fascinating. Personally, and there are many like me, holding similar thoughts but unsure how to coherently articulate and feared of ridicule, found intellectual support in this book. The book, to me, has highlighted the root cause of the blights that have plagued our country and to a large extent what the world has witnessed. The book presents a convincing argument for the decay, the constant upheaval, the disunity, restlessness and the myriad of social issues which has/(and continues) confronted us throughout since decolonisation.\\nThe author defined terms - Indigenous /Indigeneity- and recommended the use of term “indigeneity” to capture the meaning of native consciousness. I was hoping, that the author would actually coin a new term as opposed to using the word indigeneity which is a derivative of indigenous and therefore suffers it’s limited connotation. I am sure the author has his reasons.\\nSimilarly, I am but at a loss to understand why the author chose to employ the word “indic” when referencing indigenous OET and civilisation. In light of what the author has highlighted in the debates about naming the country, the word Indic equally suffers the limitations as that of the name India. Staying true to the theme of this book, decoloniality, would the word Dharma be an appropriate description of both the civilisation and the OET?\\nI have to admit upon reading all the curated passages of the proceedings in UK Parliament and those of TB Macaulay, Charles Grant, Lord Moira and including Rammohun Roy washed me with a range of usual emotions but culminating in a strong sense of shame of being a product of a covert, diabolical, systematic debasement and travesty. Certain passages were downright nauseous, revealing their utter contempt and the warped sense of reason (justification) was just unbelievable and clearly delusional. It was a deliberate insidious strategy to strip us of our self dignity and respect through denigration and undermining Dharmic OET.\\nI concur with the author’s assertion that there never was (is) a true secular government. Countries (governments) around the world are in the main, either Christian or Islamic in character. Religion and politics are inextricably woven and can never be divorced. Governments after all are made up of people. People are all influenced by religion in many ways, including those who profess to be irreligious. Therefore, it is inevitable that actions, thoughts of persons in the government will never be truly secular.\\nIt would not be an understatement to say that the 300 years of Christian colonisation of Bharat is the darkest period in its antiquity. In contrast the Islamic colonisation was at worst bloody and overt. I do take comfort, again from our antiquity, that it is not that easy to destroy our civilisation which has stood its ground time and again despite confronted with apocalyptic events and existential crisis.\\nIt is also true to say that countries which were colonised are now merely decolonised and not necessarily “independent” in its true spirit. A second war of independence is justified to truly liberate ourselves and to reclaim our lost consciousness. The enormity of the task should not be a deterrent.\\nI applaud the author for recommending materials for further reading throughout the book. Towards the end of the book, it was illuminating to read Sri Lala Lajpat Rai’s thoughts on Bharat as a nation. This book has certainly assisted me to comprehend the antagonism, hostility, veiled slur and derision in the actions of western governments and their media organisations.\\nIn conclusion, I am reminded of Swami Vivekananda’s famous quote “ Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached”. I believe this book (trilogy) aims to do just that.\\nAwaiting Book 2 eagerly.',\n",

Most likely this will be my final impression as well!\\n\\nWho should buy this book?\\nAnybody with interest in reading. If you\\'re capable of reading a book within a month then you could buy!\\n\\nWho shouldn\\'t buy this book?\\n1. This book is not for someone who wants a book as an aid to overcome fear, depression, loneliness, addition, negative thoughts, relationship struggles...\\n2. Introduction to all the problems under the sky or maybe above the sky are written in this book...\\n3. Those who already practice mindfulness, meditation, yoga might not find much stuff in this book...\\n\\nThings that will be interesting...\\n1. You might think that maybe Jay is the wisest person in the universe.\\n2. It\\'s because he didn\\'t dilute the subject matter. But he has made the content more relatable to 2020.\\n\\nAnnoying things...\\n1. Sometimes you might find Jay like a kid praising teacher to get extra marks or get some chocolates.\\n2. Don\\'t get me wrong... Without fail he has written few words about people who has acknowledged his book!\\n3. Sometimes you might get a feel like, I should become famous within 5 years & Jay will write about me\\n4. You\\'ll definitely find stuff you might not want to take from a book.\\n\\nDo you want to become rich or make him rich...\\n1. It\\'s obvious, like in almost all the books, you\\'ll find some marketing stuff at the end of the book.\\n2. There\\'s nothing wrong in that stuff but again are you ready to spend money to listen to him and to learn from him?\\n3. If you read some other self help book or teachings of the people that this book relies on; you\\'ll notice that you\\'re drawn towards meditation, positive thinking, changing lifestyle...\\n4. Unfortunately this book has the tendency to draw readers more towards Jay rather than meditation or mindfulness...\\n5. It\\'s like a fitness trainer inviting you to gym.. but rather than guiding you to exercise and get fit, the trainer is more interested in selling supplements!\\n\\nStill if you\\'re reading this review...\\n1. Go ahead and grab a copy of this book.\\n2. Suppose, if you\\'re surrounded by people who give you advice, & you don\\'t know how they became instant genius, chances are they might have read something from this book or anything from similar books\\n3. A must read for readers who wants to know what\\'s the current trend in the self help category...\\n\\nSimple advice...\\n1. I followed few rules which I have broken when I bought this book..\\n2. Here\\'s the rule: When it comes to self help, inspiration or mindfulness buy the book written by the person who\\'s an expert in that field, maybe a doctor, or phycologist, or someone who\\'s known for their specific talent like music, etc...\\n3. Another rule of thumb... It\\'s better to buy self help book written by someone who\\'s already dead or someone who\\'s about to die. It\\'s because you have their whole life before you before buying their books!\\n\\nI think this is my first review....\\nWhy I\\'m reviewing this book?\\nHonestly I\\'m disappointed. But still it\\'s not a bad book and it\\'s not a great book. It\\'s definitely not as advertised!\\nIf you\\'re ready to follow Jay then you can buy this book and do whatever he suggests in the book.\\n\\nClosing thoughts...\\nOnce you start reading this book you\\'ll get a feel like maybe you\\'re eating up huge variety of foods & you couldn\\'t identify what you are tasting!\\nReading this book is like getting a taste of all the Indian food + Chinese food + Western food + some food from sky!\\n\\nFinally...\\nWhile reading this book be ready to get interrupted by Jay himself through some social media!\\n\\nStill why I bought this book...\\n1. I\\'m surrounded by people who can speak almost about anything after watching a movie or a 5 minute video... I\\'m sure they gonna quote from this book!\\n2. I like how Jay sold so much copies of this book! Most likely he has planned everything ahead while releasing his first video!\\n\\nFinally reason for my fictional name...\\n1. I just don\\'t want people to get caught up in something popular & lose interest in their pursuit of becoming more mindful, positive, financially well, etc!\\n2. Actual reason for this name...\\nJust search in your favourite search engine, \"what was the first program written in C by it\\'s founders?\"\\n3. Yup, I like programming that\\'s why I have created this fictional name.\\n4. Guys if you\\'re really fed up with life, don\\'t give up. Start learning a programming language. Just print hello world...\\n\\nWhy everyone should print hello world...\\n1. Hello world is a way of checking if the IDE or code editor is installed correctly in the computer.\\n2. As you make more hello world programs, you\\'ll either stick with 1 programming language or you\\'ll develop interest to learn more programming languages\\n3. You\\'ll start to understand how computer behaves and understands everything as 0s and 1s...\\n\\nFinally...\\n1. Is this really a book review?\\n2. Don\\'t you feel sleepy or annoying?\\n3. This\\' how you might feel like while reading this book.\\n4. If you\\'re an avid reader and want to read something that will have an lasting impact on your life, please don\\'t start with this book!\\n5. Then what to buy since you\\'ve some amount of money to buy a book: Maybe you could buy a book written by a real monk!\\n6. Either agree or disagree: Basic always remains the same. You might see changes in the format or in the way of presentation.\\n7. If you\\'ve read the previous statement and agreed you will not invest so much on self help books. You might prefer audio books or ebooks as they\\'re relatively cheap & don\\'t take up space in your bookshelf!\\n\\nThink before buying anything....',\n",
       "  'Think Like A Monk is written by Jay Shetty who was a former monk.\\nOne day he went with his friend reluctantly to hear a monk from India whose name was Gauranga Das who was IIT Alumni. By hearing his speech, Jay got inspired to hear him more. Because Gauranga Das had left his lavishing life to become Monk. Jay was so impressed that, he even followed Gauranga Das to hear his other talks.\\nJay said everyone can adopt monk-like thinking. And in today\\'s world, everyone should since we are living stressful life day-in and day-out. Monk-like thinking can give us peace, purpose in life. In this book, he even teaches three meditation techniques to clean our minds. In this book, Jay describes how to have Monk Mind. Jay Says nowadays people follow monkey mind which is distracted, overthinking, negative, etc. He differentiates between Monkey Mind and Monk Mind so that we can clearly see which mindset is beneficial for us.\\n\\nThe first chapter is about your values. Values are important in our lives. Without them, we are like a wanderer wandering aimlessly. Values make us different from other people who don\\'t have values. The author says we should not become a person other people want us to be. We should hear our inner voice and filter out other\\'s opinions about us. To do that values help us most.\\nEvery day we should sit alone to reflect on our day, on the emotions we feel throughout the day. Because our values are tainted by external influences like News, Movies, Books we read. we should check what we are doing in our free time. Our actions should match our values. e.g if we decide that we should spend our time with Family and without doing that we played golf then our value(spending time with family) is not aligned with. So what you do in your free time defines your value. Identify your value and let them guide you. Your values help you tune out other people\\'s opinions of you.\\n\\nIn the Chapter called Negativity, the Author says that go to the root cause of your negative feeling and try to shift the focus to the positivity of the situation. Feeling negative is natural. But we choose our response to the negative situation. When you have negative thoughts, Spot, Stop, and Swap. It means Spot your negative emotions, Stop to reflect on them i.e why you are having such a negative feeling(Go to the root of such a feeling) and Swap it with other positive feelings. Negativity stems from Envy, Comparision with others, Jealousy, etc. Do not compare yourself with others. By focusing on others, you are wasting your time. That wasted time you could have used to improve yourself. Forgiveness is a great virtue anyone could have. The author gives much importance to Forgiveness. By forgiving others we are healing ourselves and our surroundings. Forgiving yourself also is a great trait.\\n\\nEveryone has got fears of some kind like loss of money, loss of respect, loss of loved ones. Instead of running from the fear one should acknowledge it, accept it and search for the root cause of that fear. One should control the reaction while facing the fear. The author says there are two types of fear 1. helpful fear 2. Hurtful fear(Loss of Loved ones). We can not control Hurtful Fear but we can control helpful fear by reacting to it calmly, objectively so that we can use it to make a progress. This is the crux of the Chapter called Fear. We can use Helpful fear as a motivator.\\nThe author says Intention is very important in achieving your goals. What is the \"why\" behind your goals? If you live your life intentionally, with the values that are internal to you, not external values that people encourage you to have, You will be satisfied. Enjoy the process of achieving your goal. Action is very important to live life intentionally. If you have just good intentions but don\\'t take action then it is just an illusion. Do your work as a service i.e out of responsibility and love. We are motivated to take action on four things: 1. Fear 2. Desire 3. Duty 4. Love. Actions taken out of duty and love are results in Satisfaction. Actions taken out of Fear and Desire result in success but you won\\'t feel satisfied.\\n\\nFind your Dharma as the author says in Chapter called Purpose. Purpose in life is very important. That is, why are you doing what you are doing? Find purpose in your Work, in your personal life, in whatever you are doing. Find in what way your work will help society. As the author says Dharma is Passion + Purpose. If there is no purpose in your passion then it is just a Hobby. Self-awareness is very important in finding your passion and purpose. Seek who you really are. In your free time instead of watching movies, youTube videos self-reflect, think about why are you the way you are? Ask questions to yourselves? Ask questions about the past actions that resulted in a failure, why did that happen?\\n\\nGratitude is an important aspect of monk mentality. The author says show gratitude in every aspect of life be it positive or negative. Kindness follows gratitude. Live with the gratitude mentality. Be gratitude conscious.\\nAll in all, the book is good...',\n",
       "  'Jay is a former monk who has now become a motivational speaker, podcaster, and author. In the book, he draws on his experience as a monk to offer advice on how to live a happier and more productive life.\\n\\nHere are five key highlights from the book:\\n1. Let go of what\\'s holding you back - in order to move forward in life, you need to let go of the things that are holding you back. This can be anything from negative thoughts and emotions to material possessions.\\n2. Be present - one of the best ways to live a happier life is to be present at the moment and appreciate what you have instead of dwelling on what you don\\'t have.\\n3. Simplify your life - another way to be happier is to simplify your life and get rid of anything that isn\\'t essential. This includes getting rid of unnecessary possessions, commitments, and relationships.\\n4. Find your purpose - another key to happiness is finding your purpose in life and pursuing it with passion. When you\\'re doing something you love, it\\'s easy to be happy and motivated.\\n5. Be grateful - finally, one of the most important things you can do for happiness is simply be grateful for what you have instead of always wanting more.\"\\n\\nThis book is ideal for anyone who wants to learn how to live a happier and more productive life by simplifying their commitments, letting go of what\\'s holding them back, being present in the moment, finding their purpose, and being grateful for what they have.\" I would rate this book 8 out of 10 because it offers some great advice but it can be a little repetitive at times.\"'],\n",
